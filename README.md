# Web-Development-Course

This is my project for the Web Development Course of my school

The basic idea behind this project was to create an eshop for a coffee shop based in Patras, Greece by letting new users create their
acounts and submit their orders online.
There were three main parts: 
(1) the order page where the customers submited their orders and filled out their
delivery address with the help of google maps
(2) the admin page where the managers of each shop logged in to review the orders status as well as the 
quantities of each item listed in the catalog-database of the eshop
(3) the delivery man page where the delivery mans logged in and declared active for service. Depending on 
their current location an order from the closest shop would be automatically pulled from the system and then
they would pick it up and deliver it to the given address. After they had the order delivered they yould choose
either if they want to continue working, in which case a new order would be pulled again depending on the current
location of the delivery man, or if they want to end their swift, in which case their salary would be computed
depending the miles they covered during their shift.

The basic idea behind it was for the delivery mans to be a kind of freelancers, not to be part of a given shop,
instead to service as many shops they could and not a particular one.
